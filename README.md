# Module 6 - Distributed Networks 

## Setup 

Followed this [link](https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh) to setup a mesh for the ESP32. The dependecies needed are: 

* ArduinoJson
* TaskScheduler
* AsyncTCP

ArduinoJSon and TaskScheduler can be found in the Arduino library manager; however, to get [AsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP), you have to download the source files and manually add it to the Arduino library.
